The increasing adoption of financing options for vehicle purchases and the rising awareness of insurance products contribute significantly to the growth of the market. Additionally, consumers are increasingly seeking financial protection against the potential loss in value of their vehicles, further boosting the demand for gap insurance. The market expansion is also driven by the growth in the automotive industry, coupled with the rising number of vehicle leases and loans worldwide. The demand for gap insurance is being fueled by factors such as increasing vehicle prices and the need for enhanced consumer protection against depreciating asset values. As vehicle prices continue to rise, the potential gap between an auto loan balance and the vehicle’s actual value is widening, which makes gap insurance more attractive. Furthermore, the growing trend of leasing vehicles and the rising number of automotive financing agreements are expected to propel the gap insurance market forward.
